coho, for "Code of Honor"
=================================
This library is a basic toolkit for writing C++ programs
from scratch. Since I left my extensive coding libraries
at previous companies, I'll be damned if I don't open
source this version so I don't have to write the basics
again. Perhaps you'll find them useful.
